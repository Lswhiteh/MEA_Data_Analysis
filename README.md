# MEA Data Analysis
*Various scripts to organize and analyze multi-channel electrode array data.*

Data was generated using a Multichannel Systems MEA2100 system [found here.](https://www.multichannelsystems.com/products/mea2100-systems)

These scripts are reliant on the file format produced by the spike detection function of a very lightly modified version of [MEATools](https://github.com/dbridges/mea-tools), the modified version is found [on my github.](https://github.com/Lswhiteh/mea-tools)

This workflow was used in the following publications:

Hedgehog pathway activation alters ciliary signaling in hypothalamic neurons (Bansal et al.)
